# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a full stack developer by accident with almost 9 intermittent years of experience.  

I've already lived in many cities like Rio de Janeiro, Braga, Frankfurt and Munich where I had the opportunity to work in some great companies and meet really amazing people.  
Now I'm back home in PetrÃ³polis, Brazil to raise my kids (most challenging task ever!), ~to plant a tree (done!)~ and to write a book.  

I have a degree in Philosophy and my passion for logics, computing and programming started after reading the logic writings of guys like Aristotle, William of Ockham, G. Frege, B. Russel and L. Wittgenstein.  

I'm also very interested in everything related to free software and hardware designs.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm also very interested in HAM Radio and RPi which I use to teach my kids programming and robotics.
- ðŸŒ± We also have a lot of fun together creating games using the Godot Engine, playing music together and chess.

I'm currently working in a project using the Laravel Environment together with D3.js to create awesome data visualizations.  

I'm looking to collaborate on any open source project that involves LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB and PHP), Laravel, D3.js, RPi or Godot Engine.
