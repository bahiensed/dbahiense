# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a philosopher in substance, a full stack web developer by accident with almost 10 intermittent years of experience and   

On principle, I'm very interested in everything related to free software and free hardware designs. I also love to tinker with those small SBCs such as the Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Banana Pi (and all the fruit salad options) which I use to teach my two kids programming, robotics 🤖 and gaming. 🎮

📧 You won't see me on social medias, so if you want to stay in touch just drop me a line by e-mail.  

🚩 I speak 🇧🇷 Portuguese, 🇩🇪 German, 🇬🇧 English, 🇦🇷 Spanish (in order of proficiency) and I'm now learning 🇮🇹 Italian. But if you want to write to me in any other language, no problem... Google can help. 😃
