# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a philosopher in substance, a full stack web developer by accident with almost 10 intermittent years of experience and a machine learning specialist and enthusiast since 2020.  

ğŸ“§ You won't see me on social medias, so if you want to stay in touch just drop me a line by e-mail.  

ğŸš© I speak ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Portuguese, ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª German, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English, ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡· Spanish (in order of proficiency) and I'm now learning ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italian. But if you want to write to me in any other language, no problem... Google can help. ğŸ˜ƒ
