- 👋 Hi, I’m Douglas Bahiense and I live in Petrópolis, Brazil.
- 👋 I'm a full stack developer in development with almost 6 intermittent years of experience, having worked in some really great companies in Europe and South America.
- 🌱 I'm currently creating SaaS solutions using the Laravel Environment together with D3.js for data visualization.
- 👀 I have a degree in Philosophy where my love for programming has begun.
- 👀 I'm also very interested in HAM Radio and RPi which I use to teach my kids programming and robotics.
- 🌱 We also have a lot of fun together creating games using the Godot Engine.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any open source project that involves LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB and PHP), Laravel, D3.js, RPi or Godot Engine.
- 📫 You'll not see me on social medias, so if you want to stay in touch just drop me a line by e-mail.
- 📫 I speak Portuguese, German, English, Spanish and I'm now learning Italian. But if you want to write to me in any other language, no problem... Google can help. :-)
