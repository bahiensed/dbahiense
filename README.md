# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a philosopher in substance and a full stack developer by accident with almost 9 intermittent years of experience.  

🌍 I've already lived in many cities like Rio de Janeiro, Braga, Frankfurt and Munich where I had the opportunity to work in some great companies and meet really amazing people that taught me a lot.  
🏡 Now I'm back home in Petrópolis, Brazil, to raise my kids (most challenging task ever!), ~to plant a tree (done!)~, to write a book and, why not, to work remotely to anybody who I can help with my sparse skills.  

📚 I have a degree in Philosophy and my passion for logics, algorithms, computing and programming started after reading the logic writings of guys like Aristotle, William of Ockham, G. Frege, B. Russel and L. Wittgenstein. (Yes, Aristotle and William too! As a matter of fact, mainly due to them both!)  

🚧 As a professional developer, in the backend I've got experience in MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and now I'm studying deeper non-relational databases such as MongoDB. Together with pure PHP, I've been using Laravel (since version 3!) and its over time changing environment in almost all big projects I've participated.  
💻 That means that in the frontend, together with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript, I've already worked with LESS, SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Vue.js & Co. and now I'm experimenting a lot with Tailwind, Alpine.js and Livewire too.  

2️⃣ Two other technologies that I'm studying deeper at the moment are Node.js and React to follow the development trends in this technological area. Innovation is unstoppable!

🆓 On principle, I'm very interested in everything related to free software and free hardware designs. I also love to tinker with those small SBCs such as the Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Banana Pi (and all the fruit salad options) which I use to teach my two sons and their friends programming, robotics 🤖 (mainly with Python) and gaming (using Godot and more recently Unity). 🎮  

📻 Other hobbies I have and share with the kids are HAM Radio (please, more CW and less FT8!), making music and playing chess. Most important we have fun after the homework! 👍  
⛰️ And almost every weekend we go to a mountain to keep in touch with nature. You can see some of our adventures [overhere](http://tv.sotabrasil.com.br).  

🧑‍🏭 I'm currently working in a project using the Laravel Environment together with D3.js to create awesome data visualizations. It goes soon public.  

😎 Here in Github, I'm looking to collaborate on any GNU licensed project that involves LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB and PHP), Laravel, D3.js, Godot Engine and Unity.

    I would probably use headings, each followed by an answers most likely wrapped in a semantic-less wrapper.
