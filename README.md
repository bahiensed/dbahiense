# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a philosopher in substance, a programmer by accident and an entrepreneur by vocation. 

Following the motto "non solum provectos debet instruere, sed (...) etiam incipientes erudire" I teach kids and teens how to code.

📧 You won't see me on social medias, so if you want to stay in touch just drop me a line by e-mail.

🚩 I speak Portuguese, German, English, Spanish (in order of proficiency) and I'm now learning Italian. But if you want to write to me in any other language, no problem... any AI translator can help. 😃
