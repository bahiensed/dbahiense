# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a philosopher in substance, a full stack developer by accident with almost 15 years of experience and an A.I. specialist and enthusiast since 2020. 

Following the motto "non solum provectos debet instruere, sed (...) etiam incipientes erudire" I teach kids and teens how to code by operating a unity of the SuperGeeks franchising in my hometown. Because of that, currently, I'm not just playing videogames in my free time, but creating them. Mainly using GDevelop and Godot Engine.

ðŸ“§ You won't see me on social medias, so if you want to stay in touch just drop me a line by e-mail.

ðŸš© I speak Portuguese, German, English, Spanish (in order of proficiency) and I'm now learning ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italian. But if you want to write to me in any other language, no problem... any A.I. translator can help. ðŸ˜ƒ
