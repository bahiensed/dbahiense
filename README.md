# Hi! I'm Douglas Bahiense...
... a philosopher in substance, a programmer by accident and an eremite by vocation. 

"Non solum provectos debet instruere, sed (...) etiam incipientes erudire."

ðŸ“§ You won't see me on social medias, so if you want to stay in touch just drop me a line by e-mail.

ðŸš© I speak Portuguese, German, English, Spanish (in order of proficiency) and I'm now learning Italian. But if you want to write to me in any other language, no problem... any AI translator can help. ðŸ˜ƒ
